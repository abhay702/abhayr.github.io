Hi, I’m **Abhay**, a professional Googler, full-time keyboard whisperer, and part-time Stack Overflow copy-paster.


###  Some of my expert-level skills include:
- Talking to servers like they’re people.
- Fixing one bug and accidentally creating three more.
- Running `docker-compose` like a prayer ritual.
- Asking ChatGPT to write bios like this one.

I built an FAQ chatbot that’s basically the office version of “ask your mom.” I also made a resume scanner that’s way better at judging resumes than HR. Fair? No. Funny? Absolutely.

### When I’m not coding, I’m probably:
- Pretending to be productive in VS Code
- Browsing [r/devops](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/?rdt=37975) like it’s group therapy
- Wondering why “it works on my machine” isn’t a valid excuse anymore

> _“Move fast and break things,” they said. So I did. And now I’m not allowed near production._

Welcome to my corner of the internet. Expect a mix of tech, sarcasm, and the occasional bug disguised as a feature.
